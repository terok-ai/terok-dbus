"""The [`ClearanceEvent`][terok_clearance.domain.events.ClearanceEvent] value type.

One flat dataclass carries every event kind the hub fans out to
subscribers.  Varlink IDL can't model sum types directly, so the
``type`` field discriminates and the remaining fields are populated
per-kind — the same pattern ``io.systemd.Resolve.Monitor`` uses.

The orchestrator-supplied identity bundle that rides on each event —
the [`Dossier`][terok_clearance.domain.events.Dossier] dict — is a
free-form string-to-string map: the wire format treats it as opaque
and the renderer only dereferences the small set of well-known keys
named by the ``DOSSIER_*`` constants below.
"""

#: Type alias for the orchestrator-supplied identity bundle resolved
#: by the shield reader at emit time.  Keys are the orchestrator's
#: contract — terok publishes ``project``, ``task``, ``name``, etc.
#: under the ``dossier.*`` OCI annotation namespace, but a non-terok
#: orchestrator may publish anything.  An empty dossier is the
#: shield-only-deployment shape; clients fall back to the bare
#: ``container`` short-id in that case.
Dossier = dict[str, str]

#: Project identifier within the orchestrator's namespace.  Combined
#: with ``DOSSIER_TASK`` to form the task triple shown in popup
#: bodies.  Empty when the orchestrator doesn't model projects.
DOSSIER_PROJECT = "project"

#: Task identifier within ``DOSSIER_PROJECT``.  Both keys must be
#: populated for the renderer to switch from a "Container: …" body
#: to a "Task: project/task · name" body.
DOSSIER_TASK = "task"

#: Human-readable label for the task or container — whatever the
#: orchestrator considers the friendly name.  For terok this tracks
#: the in-flight task name (renamable; resolved on every emit from
#: the meta-path JSON file).
DOSSIER_NAME = "name"

#: Container name as the runtime sees it.  Optional — in practice
#: equal to ``DOSSIER_NAME`` for terok, but the orchestrator may
#: set them separately (e.g. a stable container name plus a
#: human-edited task name).
DOSSIER_CONTAINER_NAME = "container_name"
